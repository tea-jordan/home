    <h1>Creating a Cellular Automata Animator in Java</h1>
    <br>
    <p>While studying Java and object-oriented design, my teacher shared an interesting topic with me called 
        Cellular Automata (CA). These are systems made up by a collection of elements, or cells. Each cell can 
        exist in a set number of states <b>({0, 1}, {off, on}, etc)</b>. With an initial state created, all of the cells 
        in a CA will then change over time based on simple rules, which use the states of a cell's neighbors 
        as inputs. Systems that could grow and change themselves based on simple rules interested me, and some of
        the patterns these systems could create were very neat. For this reason I decided to create a program in 
        Java that could animate the changes of CA systems. There were two main systems I animated: the first is 
        based on <a href = "https://www.wolframscience.com/">Stephen Wolfram's CA rules</a>. The second 
        is based on a paper that was published in Scientific American in the 70's by the mathematician John Conway. 
        <a href = "https://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html">Conway's Game of Life</a> is a game 
        that uses a 2-D CA to show how cells in a table change over time. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h5>1-D Cellular Automata Rules</h5>
    <p>The simplest form of a CA we can make is 1-D, where cells are stored in an array. For the CA to change over 
        time, cells need to change based on the states of their neighbors. The simplest neighborhood we can define 
        for any cell in this array is of length 3, which includes: <b>{a cell's left neighbor, the cell itself, and a
        cell's right neighbor}</b>. Because each neighborhood is of length 3, and each cell in a neighborhood can 
        have the state 0 or 1, this means that for any given neighborhood, there are 2^3 = 8 possible configurations of 
        states <b>(e.g., {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {0, 1, 1}, etc...)</b>. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For this reason, to change the CA over time, we need to specify what to do if any one of these 8 configurations occurs. 
        This can be done by converting the state's binary representation to an integer. For example, {0, 0, 0} 
        converts to 0, {0, 0, 1} to 1, ... up to {1, 1, 1} to 7. Because the states will always convert to an 
        integer between 0 - 7 (inclusive), we can make the rule an array of length 8 (indexed at 0), and then use 
        the neighborhood's configuration to get an index for the cells next change. For example 
        {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} would turn every cell in the next generation to a 0, because any index returns the 
        value 0, and {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1} would make any configuration result in a 1. Interestingly, even for 
        this simple configuration of neighborhoods of 3, because the rule array itself is of length 8, there are 
        2^8 = 256 possible rules for changing the CA! For my project, I let the user input a rule as an integer 
        between 0 - 255, which is then converted to binary to create the rule array. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Displaying how the CA rules can change over time is done in the following way. First, we create a starting 
        state where every cell is 0, except for one cell in the middle of the array that is 1. We display this row to 
        the screen, giving every 0 cell a certain color, and every 1 cell a different color. Then, we loop over 
        all cells and calculate what the state in the next iteration should be based on the current rule. Then, the 
        prior display is shifted up by a pixel's height, and the new state is displayed below it. This process repeats 
        until we're bored. Below are some examples of cool patterns that can be generated by different rules:

    <hr>
    <br>
    <h5>2-D Game of Life</h5>
    <p>
      For the 2-D CA, we handle the rules a bit differently. For any cell in a 2-D matrix, the neighborhood includes 
      the 3x3 grid around the cell, with the cell at its center. If a neighborhood of 3 resulted in 8 combinations 
      and 256 possible rules, you can imagine how many combinations / rules would result from a neighborhood of 9 
      cells. For this reason, Conway's game uses simpler rules. The number of active neighbors in a neighborhood are 
      counted, and then different choices can be made for the next state: <i>(e.g., if only 1 cell is alive, it is too 
      lonely and will die, if exactly 3 cells are alive, then give birth to a new cell, if >= 6 are alive, a cell may 
      die from being too croweded, else do nothing)</i>. To start the game of life, we create a 2-D matrix of 
      numbers, and use a random number generator to set them to 0 or 1:
    </p>
    <pre><!-- <code>-->
        <img class = "blank_GOL" src = "images/random_table.PNG" alt = "randomized-gol-table">
    </pre> <!-- </code>-->
    <br>
    <p>Then, we can loop over every cell, calculate the next state for its neighborhood of 9, and update that to
        the next state. Once all cells are calculated, the changed state can be updated to the display. Here's an 
        example of what the game board looks like after running for a couple of seconds. <i>(Note: purple indicates 
        the death of a cell, and orange indicates the birth of a new cell)</i>.

    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
      This was a fun project to get more fluent with Java and object-oriented design. I find the patterns that 
      can be created very interesting, and want to work on more computer generated art projects. For any who are 
      interested in the topic, Thomas Lin Pederson has created <a href = "https://thomaslinpedersen.art/work/">some cool artwork</a> 
      using the R language.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>For any who want to see more of the code, this was designed using the Model, View, Controller (MVC) 
        pattern, which made separating the data and GUI display elements much easier.
