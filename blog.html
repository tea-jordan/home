    <h1>Business Reporting Applications of R Programming</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Since one of my professors in my MBA program, Dr. Yonggang (Tim) Lu, introduced me to R programming, 
      I have come to appreciate it in my job as a data analyst.  The capabilities of R have helped simplify 
      the process of understanding large datasets and generating reports for end users. Below I will outline a couple of 
      different use-cases with example code showing how R scripting can aid the process of wrangling and reporting 
      information. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h5>Libraries</h5>
    <p>Part of what makes using R so helpful are the well-developed libraries for different data science functions. These include 
      the tidyverse library (with packages like dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot2 for data visualization), readxl for 
      importing data from excel & csv formats, and openxlsx which is useful for creating excel output files from R objects. Many 
      of the use-cases shared below rely on these packages, and the code will assume that the libraries are 
      loaded in your environment. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class = "keyword">library</span><span class ="specchar">(</span>tidyverse<span class = "specchar">)</span>
      <span class = "keyword">library</span><span class ="specchar">(</span>readxl<span class = "specchar">)</span>
      <span class = "keyword">library</span><span class ="specchar">(</span>openxlsx<span class = "specchar">)</span>

    <h5>Loading Initial Datasets into R</h5>
    <p>
      Our company's system has many different data fields, and our managers track KPIs through fields flagged as "required". These 
      required data fields are considered important to operations and are evaluated for accuracy. For each reporting period our 
      system automatically generates a report with each file and data field value. This report regularly 
      includes more than 10,000 records of more than 50 unique variables (required fields). It would be too time consuming to review
      this much data manually, so thankfully R offers a better way. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To start the .csv or .xlsx file from our system's report can be read into a data frame in R using the readxl package.
      Ideally our data is in table format of some kind, with rows as the observations and columns as the variables. If the format
      of the starting document is not in perfect table format, we can write cleanup steps in our script after loading to make the data 
      fit into a proper table/dataframe format.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df <span class = "specchar">=</span> read_xlsx<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "char">"C:/Users/my-user-id/Desktop/folder/file-name.xlsx"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      Or depending on your reporting timeframe, multiple versions of the same file can be read at once using a loop. In my case the system runs 
      reports monthly which I aggregate into a quarterly report. For this reason, using a loop to read all three files and 
      then merge them into one combined data frame helps save time. (To save space, some example cleanup tasks such as removing empty columns
      have been written into the loop as well):
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      filenames <span class = "specchar">=</span> c<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "char">"file1"</span>, <span class = "char">"file2"</span>, <span class = "char">"file3"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
          
      output_list <span class = "specchar">=</span> list<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>

      <span class = "keyword">for</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span> i <span class = "keyword">in</span> filenames<span class = "specchar">) {</span>
  
        <span class = "comment"># read file and save it as a dataframe in the output list</span>

        <span class = "comment"># cleanup & removing duplicate rows of dataframes in output list </span>
        empty_cols <span class = "specchar">=</span> sapply<span class = "specchar">(</span>output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span>, function<span class = "specchar">(</span>x<span class = "specchar">)</span> all<span class = "specchar">(</span>is.na<span class = "specchar">(</span>x<span class = "specchar">)))</span>
        output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span> <span class = "specchar">=</span> output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span><span class = "specchar">[</span>,<span class = "specchar">!</span>empty_cols<span class = "specchar">]</span>
        output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span> <span class = "specchar">=</span> output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span> <span class = "specchar">%>%</span> distinct<span class = "specchar">()</span>
        rm<span class = "specchar">(</span>i, empty_cols<span class = "specchar">)</span>
            
      <span class = "specchar">}</span>
          
      <span class = "comment"># Using the rowbind function to combine all three dataframes into one</span>
      combined_df <span class = "specchar">=</span> rbind<span class = "specchar">(</span>output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span><span class = "char">"file1"</span><span class = "specchar">]]</span>, output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span><span class = "char">"file2"</span><span class = "specchar">]]</span>, output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span><span class = "char">"file3"</span><span class = "specchar">]])</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      Now that we have the monthly files combined into one quarterly data frame, we can write expressions to convert 
      data into appropriate types, validate the data based on rules, or create calculated fields for our final report that 
      are not available in the base report. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h5>Checking Data Types from Excel or CSV Sources</h5>
    <p>After loading data into R, it is a good idea to check the data types prior to calculating new fields or preparing the 
      report for end users. Excel or CSV files tend to do strange things with data types. For example, numbers may be stored as 
      text rather than a true numeric, which we may or may not want. Sometimes having numbers stored as text is important (if we
      have unique ID numbers that could start with '0', then storing them as true numerics would lose the first digit of the ID #).
      Other times, if we want to perform calculations with numbers it is important they are stored as true numerics. To check 
      the data type of an imaginary column 'x' in our dataframe 'df', we can use the simple expression:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      class<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>x<span class = "specchar">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      This will log the data type of column x to the console. In R some of the basic data types include character (text), 
      numeric (numbers with decimal values), integer (whole numbers), logical (TRUE/FALSE), and POSIXct - a specific format for dates. If we see a data type that is 
      incorrect, it is possible to force coercion of data types in R. For imaginary columns 'a', 'b', and 'c' in our dataframe, 
      if we wanted to convert their data types to numeric, character, and logical, respectively, we could write:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>a <span class = "specchar">=</span> as.numeric<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>a<span class = "specchar">)</span>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>b <span class = "specchar">=</span> as.character<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>b<span class = "specchar">)</span>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>c <span class = "specchar">=</span> as.logical<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>c<span class = "specchar">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      It is good to be careful while doing this, because sometimes 
      we can lose information if values are coerced incorrectly. In the example above: if we had character text showing ID numbers 
      and converted these to numeric, any ID #s starting with '0' could lose their first digit. Sometimes you will see R throw the 
      error "NAs introduced by coercion". This means that some data values were lost in the chang and set to 'NA', because 
      R did not know how to handle the coercion. One common reason that causes this when converting numbers stored as text to true 
      numbers is if the numbers in Excel or CSV are written with commas: ($1,200.00) won't be converted to (1200) using as.numeric 
      due to the '$' and ',' values stored as text. When this happens we want to double check the values in the original data set and 
      make adjustments as needed to our script before proceeding. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h5>Subsetting Datasets Based on Certain Values</h5>
    <p>
      In some reviews we want to look at the dataset as a whole, but it can also be useful to subset the dataset based on 
      certain values. R makes subsetting dataframes easy using square bracket notation: df[ , ]. In this notation, anything
      on the left-side of the comma refers to rows, and anything on the right side refers to columns. In this way the subset
      df[1 , ] would return the entire first row of our dataframe, and the subset df[ , 2] would return the entire second column (R-indexing 
      starts on 1, not 0!).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Luckily subsetting does not need to use just index numbers. We can subset using different operators to retrieve certain parts of
      the dataset that are of interest to us. Some useful operators in R include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> == </strong> - is equal to, <em>two equals signs are used because the single = is used for assignment of objects in R</em></li>
      <li><strong> != </strong> - not equal to</li> 
      <li><strong> < </strong> - less than</li>
      <li><strong> <= </strong> - less than or equal to</li>
      <li><strong> > </strong> - greater than</li>
      <li><strong> >= </strong> - greater than or equal to</li>
      <li><strong> a & b </strong> - a and b</li>
       <li><strong> a | b </strong> - a or b</li>
      <li><strong> a %like% "xyz" </strong> - pattern matching, tests if "a" includes the pattern "xyz" somewhere, this is useful for text data</li>
      <li><strong> a %in% some-sequence </strong> - determines whether "a" is in some sequence of objects. useful for subsetting large datasets by a list of pre-defined values for certain variables</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      For a simple example, if we wanted to check our dataset to see which records had incomplete values for the variable "Name", we
      could write:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df<span class = "specchar">[</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>Name <span class = "specchar">%like%</span> <span class = "char">"unknown"</span> <span class = "specchar">|</span> df<span class = "specchar">$</span>Name <span class = "specchar">%like%</span> <span class = "char">"John Doe"</span>, <span class = "specchar">]</span>
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This will return all rows in the dataframe where the conditions "Column 'Name' is like 'unknown'" or "Column 'Name' is like 'John Doe'" are true.
      With the number of operators available, there is always a way to find whichever subset you are looking for.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h5>Creating Calculated Fields</h5>
    <p>
      Once we have our data in the desired format in R, we may want to create some new fields based on existing variables in the 
      dataset. Creating calculating fields can help us learn more information about our topic of interest. Adding calculated fields is 
      very easy in R because R can take columns of a dataframe as inputs, perform operations 
      element wise down columns, and generate a new column as an output. For example, say we have a health dataset with variables 
      height and weight, among others. If we wanted to add a calculated field for BMI, we can write the following:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>BMI <span class = "specchar">=</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>weight <span class = "specchar">/</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>height<span class = "specchar">**</span><span class = "num">2</span><span class = "specchar">))</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      This expression will add on a new column "BMI" to our dataframe, with a calculated BMI based off of the "health" and "weight"
      columns for each record in the dataset.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      We can also use existing variables in our R environment combined with logical expressions to create more complex calculated 
      fields. Managers at my company track different KPIs by users for performance management purposes. In one example, we receive 
      a report of actions taken per month for each user. However, the KPI and associated goal state that each user in the department 
      should take at least one action per day. To turn the monthly actions into a more meaningful figure we can do the following. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      First, we will create a new variable for the number of working days in the month <em>(using bizdays package which lets you calculate 
      business days in given timeframes)</em> For this example the month reviewed will be January:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      janWorkdays <span class = "specchar">=</span> bizdays<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "char">"2022-01-01"</span>, <span class = "char">"2022-02-01"</span>, <span class = "char">"weekends"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      In this example we plan on dividing the monthly actions for January by the number of workdays in January to calculate the actions 
      per day for each user. However, if an employee was hired sometime in January, they may not have worked for every working day in the month, 
      and this calculation could unfairly lower their KPI result for the month. To work around this, we will create a new calculated 
      field using the users date of hire (DOH), and adding this new calculated field to the dataset:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>daysFromDOH <span class = "specchar">=</span> bizdays<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>DOH, <span class = "char">"2022-02-01"</span>, <span class = "char">"weekends"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      Next, we will create a new column of our dataframe with the dummy value of 0 to hold space for our final calculated field.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      df<span class = "specchar">$</span>janActionsPerDay <span class = "specchar">=</span> <span class = "num">0</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      Finally, we can write a loop with logical tests to update the janActionsPerDay field based on the appropriate calculation 
      for a user's date of hire:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class = "keyword">for</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span>i <span class = "keyword">in</span> <span class = "num">1</span><span class = "specchar">:</span>length<span class = "specchar">(</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>user<span class = "specchar">)) {</span>
          
          <span class = "keyword">if</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span> df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"daysFromDOH"</span><span class = "specchar">] <</span> janWorkdays<span class = "specchar">) {</span>
              
              df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"janActionsPerDay"</span><span class = "specchar">] =</span> round<span class = "specchar">((</span>df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"janActions"</span><span class = "specchar">] /</span> df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"daysFromDOH"</span><span class = "specchar">])</span>, <span class = "num">4</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
          
          <span class = "specchar">}</span> <span class = "keyword">else </span><span class = "specchar">{</span>
              
              df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"janActionsPerDay"</span><span class = "specchar">] =</span> round<span class = "specchar">((</span>df<span class = "specchar">[</span>i, <span class = "char">"janActions"</span><span class = "specchar">] /</span> janWorkdays<span class = "specchar">)</span>, <span class = "num">4</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>   
          
          <span class = "specchar">}</span>
      
      <span class = "specchar">}</span>  
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>With this loop our calculated field will be more accurate based on the logical test used in the loop, which will make
      KPI testing easier for end users. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h5>Creating Sub-Reports with Looping for Multiple End-Users</h5>
    <p>Another way R can help with business reporting is with generating individual reports for end users based on a subset of a 
      larger data frame. At my company our department gets data for all users that needs to be reported out to team managers. There are 
      roughly 20 teams, which makes it time consuming using excel, pivot tables, etc. to filter and share data. Luckily, 
      using for loops R can solve this problem quickly. First we will create a character vector with the names of our team managers,
      and then will use a loop to subset the full dataset into individual dataframes by team:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      teamManagers <span class = "specchar">=</span> c<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "char">"John Doe"</span>, <span class = "char">"Jane Doe"</span>, <span class = "char">"D. Vader"</span>, etc..., <span class = "char">"P. Leia"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
      output_list <span class = "specchar">=</span> list<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>

      <span class = "keyword">for</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span>i <span class = "keyword">in</span> teamManagers<span class = "specchar">) {</span>
            
            output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]] = </span>df<span class = "specchar">[</span>df<span class = "specchar">$</span>Manager <span class = "specchar">==</span> i, <span class = "specchar">]</span>
      
      <span class = "specchar">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>Once each team's individual table is saved as its own item in the output list, we can do any number of functions on the
      individual team data, and then use the openxlsx package to save output excel files back to our computer for each individual
      manager.    
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      <span class = "keyword">for</span> <span class = "specchar">(</span>i <span class = "keyword">in</span> teamManagers<span class = "specchar">) {</span>
            
            write.xlsx<span class = "specchar">(</span>x<span class = "specchar"> =</span> </span>output_list<span class = "specchar">[[</span>i<span class = "specchar">]]</span>, file <span class = "specchar">=</span> paste<span class = "specchar">(</span><span class = "char">"C:/Users/my-user-id/Desktop/folder/"</span>, i, <span class = "char">".xlsx"</span><span class = "specchar">)</span>
      
      <span class = "specchar">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p>
      This will create individual workbooks with the subset data that can be sent out to each team manager. With the same logic and use
      of loops, you can do many different thing such as create data visualizations for specific teams, calculate summary statistics, etc.
      With these kinds of operations I like to create a folder within my directory named "Excel_Outputs", or "PNG_Outputs" for data visualizations
      and save output files to these sub-folders so that the main working directory does not get disorganized with too many files.

    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
      I am newer to programming with R, but have found it helpful for many different aspects of working with data. If you have
      any thoughts please feel free to reach out, I'd love to learn about how you use R!
